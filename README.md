# README

This project captures my solution for the Udacity TV script generation problem, using Recurrent Neural Networks, part of the [Deep Learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

The specific project can be found at the [Udacity GitHub project page](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation).
