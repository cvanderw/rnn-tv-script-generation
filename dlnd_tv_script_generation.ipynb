    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "It took a surprisingly long time to come up with a reasonable set of hyperparameters (at least to train to get to a loss below 3.5). Before working on this problem I had completed a [project](https://github.com/cvanderw/cnn-dog-classification) using a CNN and the lesson I took from that was to start with a super simple model to avoid overfitting. Given that hard-earned lesson I opted to start with some super simple hyperparameters:\n",
    "  - sequence_lenth: 200.\n",
    "  - batch_size: 20. (I learned that a batch_size of 100 could cripple my GPU :( .)\n",
    "  - learning_rate: 0.01\n",
    "  - embedding_dim: 400\n",
    "  - hidden_dim: 256 (a nice power of two)\n",
    "  - n_layers: 2\n",
    "  \n",
    "These parameters seemed like a reasonable starting point for experimentation. Unfortunately, training went almost nowhere, not getting below an error rate of 5.0. The first thing I tried to change was the learning rate, dropping to 0.001 and this helped a bit. I made other sweeping changes such as slowly increasing the hidden_dims from 256 to 512 to 700 and finally to 800. I also increased the embedding_dim from 400 to 200 to 500 to finally 1000. Oddly, these _increases_ improved the model, whereas my learning from the CNN project seemed to suggest a more complex model may end up with overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next major insight I got was that my initial sequence length of 200 was a terrible choice. The whole point of this project is to predict the next word in the script and 200 words seems *way* too much context to determine a follow on word. Instead, I opted to slowly drop the size. As I dropped the sequence length I increased the batch size and the two changes together made a big difference. I went as low as a sequence length of 5 but later increased to 8 because (and really it's just a matter of taste) 5 words seemed to not quite be enough context for a single sentence (at this point it's more art than science). As I saw the error rate go down substantially I decided that it's just a matter of number of iterations until I can get a good score so I adjusted the number of epochs accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final hyperparameter values are as follows:\n",
    "  - sequence_lenth: 8.\n",
    "  - batch_size: 256. (another nice power of two)\n",
    "  - num_epochs: 12\n",
    "  - learning_rate: 0.001\n",
